  Preheat the oven to 350\degrees F.  Using a paring knife or other small knife,

  in half and cut out any leftover seeds or membrane.
  \ing[1]{tbsp}{tablespoon canola oil}
  \ing[1]{pound}{lean ground turkey}
  In a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium-high heat, add a drizzle of
  canola oil. Once the oil is hot, add in the ground turkey, breaking it apart
  as it browns.

  Once the turkey browns, drain off any excess liquid. Add in the Sloppy Joe
  sauce, cook for 2 minutes, and then cover and reduce heat to low.
